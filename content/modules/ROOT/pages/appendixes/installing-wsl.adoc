# Installing WSL

https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl[Windows Subsystem for Linux] (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using Windows, it is recommended to install WSL as all the commands use bash.
====

You can install everything you need to run Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by entering this command in an administrator PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt and then restarting your machine:

[source, sh]
----
wsl --install
----

This command will enable the required optional components, download the latest Linux kernel, set WSL 2 as your default, and install a Linux distribution for you (Ubuntu by default).

The first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you'll be asked to wait for files to de-compress and be stored on your machine.
All future launches should take less than a second.
