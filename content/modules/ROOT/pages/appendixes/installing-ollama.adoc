# Installing LLAMA3

To install LLAMA 3, we will use https://ollama.ai/[ollama].

If you use Linux or Mac, download ollama from [ollama's download page](https://ollama.ai/download) and follow the installation instructions.

Once installed, you should have access to the `ollama` command line tool:

[source, shell]
----
$ ollama --version
ollama version is 0.1.32
----

Ollama can run multiple models, as you can see on [ollama's library](https://ollama.ai/library).
We will use the `llama3` model.

To download and run the llama3 model, execute: 

[source, shell]
----
$ ollama run llama3
----


[.warning]
==== 
The https://ollama.com/library/llama3[Mistral] model is quite large (> 4.1GB). Make sure you have enough disk space.
==== 

You can check the list of available models locally by doing :

[source, shell]
----
ollama list
NAME            	ID          	SIZE  	MODIFIED
llama3:latest   	a6990ed6be41	4.7 GB	2 days ago
----

Once pulled, we will be able to use it.
